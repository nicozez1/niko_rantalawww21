                <h2>BJJ</h2>
                <blockquote>At age fourteen, Hélio Gracie, the youngest of the brothers, moved in with his older brothers who lived and taught traditional Japanese jiu-jitsu in a house in Botafogo. 
                    Following a doctor's recommendations, Hélio would spend the next few years being limited to watching his brothers teach as he was naturally frail. Over time, Hélio Gracie gradually developed Gracie Jiu Jitsu as a softer, pragmatic adaptation from Judo, as he was unable to perform many Judo moves that require direct opposition to an opponent's strength. 
                    Through the years Helio Gracie developed a system that focused on ground fighting, as opposed to Judo which emphasizes throwing techniques. 
                    Years later Helio Gracie Challenged Judo's legend Masahiko Kimura. According to Kimura in his book "My Judo", He thought of Hélio Gracie to be a 6th dan judo at the time of his fight with him in 1951.[10] However, there is no Kodokan record of Hélio Gracie having any dan grade in judo, 
                    but it is not unusual for a foreign judoka's actual grade to be higher than that officially granted and recorded by the Kodokan, 
                    as Kodokan ranks are maintained independently and have much more strict requirements.</blockquote>
